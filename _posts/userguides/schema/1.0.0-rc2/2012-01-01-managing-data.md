---

Every table in Kiji has an associated layout. The layout of a table contains a
baseline schema definition which can be used to access the majority of the
information in the table without further special knowledge.  Each table's layout
describes the set of columns which can exist in any given row.  For each column,
a minimal "reader" schema is specified; this provides multiple team members
working with a large data set with a common data dictionary; it also enables
validation of cell data against a reference schema.  The layout also describes
some additional properties of the table; these are discussed in this section as
well.

Every data element in Kiji is stored in a Kiji cell, which is uniquely
identified by an entity ID, column name, and timestamp.  The column name is itself
two components: a family name and a qualifier.  As in HBase, these are written
`family:qualifier`.  Data written to a Kiji cell is serialized to a byte array
according to an Avro schema.  The writer schema used for the particular write
operation is stored alongside the cell data, so the input data can be
deserialized exactly by subsequent read requests. But this schema must be
compatible with the expected reader schema specified in the layout for the cell.

A JSON layout descriptor is a specification for the locality groups,
columns, and data types that comprise a table, written as a JSON
document whose elements are described in the following subsections.  We will
refer to the following example layout file throughout this section:

{% highlight js %}
{
  name: "users",
  description: "A bunch of made-up users",
  version: "kiji-1.0",
  keys_format: {encoding: "HASH"},
  locality_groups: [ {
    name: "default",
    description: "The default locality group",
    in_memory: false,
    max_versions: 1,
    ttl_seconds: 7776000,
    compression_type: "NONE",
    families: [ {
      name: "info",
      description: "A bunch of fields",
      columns: [ {
        name: "id",
        description: "user id hash",
        column_schema: {type: "INLINE", value: '"string"'}
      }, {
        name: "name",
        description: "The person's name",
        column_schema: {type: "INLINE", value: '"string"'}
      }, {
        name: "email",
        description: "The person's email",
        column_schema: {type: "INLINE", value: '"string"'}
      } ]
    }, {
      name: "searches",
      description: "The recent search queries the user has made",
      map_schema: {type: "CLASS", value: "com.search.avro.Search"}
    } ]
  } ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

The schema of the table layout descriptor is available in the KijiSchema source tree at
[Layout.avdl](#ref.table_layout_desc).

### Overall structure of a table layout

At the top-level, a table contains:

*  the table name and description;
*  a description of the row keys encoding;
*  the table locality groups.

Each locality group has:

*  a primary name, unique within the table, a description and optionally some name aliases;
*  whether the data is to be stored in memory or on disk;
*  data retention lifetime;
*  maximum number of versions to keep;
*  type of compression;
*  column families stored in this locality group.

Each column family has:

*  a primary name, unique within the table, a description and optionally some name aliases;
*  for map-type families, the Avro schema of the cell values;
*  for group-type families, the collection of columns in the group.

Each column in a group-type family has:

*  a primary name, unique within the family, a description and optionally some name aliases;
*  an Avro schema.

All names must start with a letter and may only use letters, numbers, and underscores.

### Group-type and map-type families

In KijiSchema, there are two kinds of column families:

*  Group-type families define a fixed set of named columns.  In the example
   layout above, there is a single group-type family named `info`, containing
   the columns `info:id`, `info:name`, and `info:email`, each with their own
   Avro schema.  Each row may contain any subset of these three columns, but may
   not contain any additional columns.

*  Map-type families define a family where the cell column qualifiers are not
   explicitly defined.  In the example layout above, the map-type family named
   `searches` may be used to store every search performed by a user, each with
   their own column qualifier; cell columns would have names of the form
   `searches:<search-terms>`; the contents of each cell might be a compound Avro
   record containing the list of products returned by the query specified in the
   cell's qualifier, as well as a boolean for each indicating whether the user
   actually clicked that search result.  A map-type column specifies a single Avro
   schema for all its column.  Note that the column qualifiers used in a map-type
   family must be valid UTF-8 strings (rather than arbitrary byte arrays).

### Kiji cell schema

Within a table, Kiji cells are encoded according to their declared schema.
There are three types of Kiji cell schemas, specified using the `type` field:

*  `INLINE` - field `value` contains an the JSON representation of an Avro
   schema.  In the earlier example, all three columns contain a single Avro
   `"string"` field, but a column could also contain an array, record or other
   complex Avro data type.
*  `CLASS` - field `value` contains the fully-qualified name of a Java class
   mapped by an Avro data type, like an implementation of `SpecificRecord`.  The
   user must ensure that the class is available on the classpath of any Kiji
   tools accessing the cell.
*  `COUNTER` - cells are encoded as long integers and support atomic increment
   or decrement operations.

The schema of cells in a group-type family is specified by the `column_schema`
field (see columns `info:id`, `info:name`, `info:email` in the example layout).
The schema of cells in a map-type family is specified by the `map_schema` field
(see map-type family `searches` in the example layout).

### Locality groups

All families within a locality group are stored together in HBase.  It is
usually a good idea to put families that are often read and written together
into the same locality group.

Locality groups control the physical properties of the underlying storage:

*  `in_memory` - when this boolean flag is set, Kiji configures HBase to keep as
   much of this locality group in memory as possible.
*  `ttl_seconds` - cells' time to live : cells older that this number of seconds
   may be automatically discarded.
*  `max_versions` - maximum number of timestamped versions of cells to retain :
   as new versions of a cell are written, older versions are deleted to not
   exceed this limit.
*  `compression` - one of `NONE`, `GZ`, `LZO` or `SNAPPY`.

### Names

Locality groups, families, and columns are identified by their primary names.
The primary name may be changed with the help of the `renamed_from` field.
For example, to rename the `default` locality group into `new_name`, one may
update the table layout with a locality group descriptor as follows:

{% highlight js %}
locality_groups: [ {
  name: "new_name",
  renamed_from: "default",
  ...
} ]
{% endhighlight %}

Table names may not be changed.


### Layout record descriptor <a name="ref.table_layout_desc" id="ref.table_layout_desc"></a>

For reference, the Avro descriptor for table layout records is defined in
`src/main/avro/Layout.avdl` within the kiji-schema git project as follows:
